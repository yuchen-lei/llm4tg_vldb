    Please provide the results in JSON format.
    The result should be a dict indicating which features are the most obvious characteristics of the graph.
    The keys should be the feature names, and the values should be the one of reason.
    The reference graphs are the graphs that are used to compare with the query graph.
    The meaning of the keys representing graph characteristics are as follows:
      S2-2: The maximum out-degree in graph.
      S1-6: The standard deviation of the in-degree and out-degree in graph. 
      S1-2: The standard deviation of in-degree in graph. 
      S3: The degree correlation of graph. 
      PAIa21-1: The ratio of the minimum input token amount of an address node to the total input token amount of an address node. 
      PTIa41-2: The minimum transaction time interval of an address node. 
      S6: The longest distance between any two nodes in graph. 
      S5: The closeness centrality of graph.
      CI3a32-2: The maximum value of the ratio of the change in in-degree to each transaction time interval for the address node in chronological order. 
      S7: The density of graph.  
    The features of reference graphs are shown below.

    Find out the most important 3 features of the graph.
    And explain why you think these features are the most important.
    e.g.: the value is higher or lower than average of reference graphs.
