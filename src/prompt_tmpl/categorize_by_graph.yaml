    Find out the top 3 possible categories of the graph.
    Just like the reference graphs' label, the category is one of follows:
    [blackmail, darknet market, exchange, gambling, money laundering, ponzi, pool, tumbler]
    Try to think which features can help you making the decision. e.g.: the value or structure comparing to reference graphs.
    output this reason as the last value of the list.
    The result should follow this scheme: {{ 'result': [ top 3 categories,, ], 'reason': 'reason for making decision.' }}
    The graph to anaylze:
    {graph}
