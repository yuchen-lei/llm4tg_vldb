    Please provide the results in JSON format.
    You should output a list with the top 3 possible categories (label) based on the comparation with the reference graphs.
    The reference graphs are the graphs that are used to compare with the query graph.
    The meaning of the keys representing graph characteristics are as follows:
      S2-2: The maximum out-degree in graph.
      S1-6: The standard deviation of the in-degree and out-degree in graph. 
      S1-2: The standard deviation of in-degree in graph. 
      S3: The degree correlation of graph. 
      PAIa21-1: The ratio of the minimum input token amount of an address node to the total input token amount of an address node. 
      PTIa41-2: The minimum transaction time interval of an address node. 
      S6: The longest distance between any two nodes in graph. 
      S5: The closeness centrality of graph.
      CI3a32-2: The maximum value of the ratio of the change in in-degree to each transaction time interval for the address node in chronological order. 
      S7: The density of graph.  
    The features of reference graphs are shown below.

    Find out the top 3 possible categories of the graph.
    Just like the reference graphs' label, the category is one of follows:
    [blackmail, darknet market, exchange, gambling, money laundering, ponzi, pool, tumbler]
    Try to think which features can help you making the decision. e.g.: the value is higher or lower than average of reference graphs.
    output this reason as the last value of the list.
    The result should follow this scheme: {{ 'result': [ top 3 categories,, ], 'reason': 'reason for making decision.' }}
    The graph to anaylze:
