# Supplemental Materials for "Advancing Transaction Graph Analysis with Large Language Models: A Case Study on Bitcoin Networks"

This repository contains the supplemental materials associated with the paper titled "Advancing Transaction Graph Analysis with Large Language Models: A Case Study on Bitcoin Networks." Here, you will find the source code, results, and analysis scripts used in our study. The materials are organized into three main directories: `src`, `result`, and `analyze`.

## Directory Structure
  - `src`: Contains the main code that was used to conduct the experiments described in the paper.
  - `result`: Includes intermediate files produced by the code in `src` as well as responses from large language models (LLMs).
  - `analyze`: Contains scripts used to draw figures or calculate measurements for the analysis presented in the paper.

## File Naming Convention

The files across the directories are prefixed with numbers that relate to the four levels of analysis described in the paper:

    Files beginning with 1- are related to the preparation of experiments.
    Files beginning with 2- are related to Level 1 analysis.
    Files beginning with 3- are related to Level 2 analysis.
    Files beginning with 4- are related to Level 3 analysis.
    Files beginning with 5- are related to Level 4 analysis.
    Files beginning with 6- contain scripts related to additional experiments.

## Note
Originally, all files were placed in the same directory. For analysis scripts, try to locate their input files in the result directory, as this is where intermediate files are stored.
