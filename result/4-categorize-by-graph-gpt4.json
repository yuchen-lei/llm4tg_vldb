Additionally, there is a significant amount of funds flowing through the network, similar to an exchange, but the complex, non-linear flow is more typical of tumbling or money laundering activities."

    "llm_explain": "The graph shows a pattern of transactions that are typical for a tumbler service, where small amounts are mixed and split across multiple transactions and addresses to obfuscate the traceability of the funds. There is a high in-degree and out-degree at a certain layer, which indicates a mixing service. Additionally, the presence of transactions with multiple input and output nodes is a characteristic often seen in exchanges and darknet markets. However, the pattern is most aligned with tumbler services due to the high volume of transactions intended to increase anonymity, which is less common in the typical operation of exchanges or darknet markets."
